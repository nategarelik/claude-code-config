## Purpose
Decompose a problem to its fundamental truths and rebuild solutions from there.

## Process
1. **Identify assumptions** - What are we taking for granted?
2. **Question each** - Why do we believe this?
3. **Find fundamentals** - What is indisputably true?
4. **Rebuild** - What solutions emerge from fundamentals?

## Output
- List of assumptions identified
- Fundamental truths discovered
- Novel solutions that emerge
